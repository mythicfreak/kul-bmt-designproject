\section{Assumptions}
\label{sec:assumptions}
\autoref{fig:events} shows how complex even the initial events during a
collision are. As it would be too difficult to analyse these subsequent
situations without the proper software, only the first event (A) is
taken into account to reduce the complexity. To decrease the complexity even
more, a number of assumptions are made. In the following paragraphs these
assumptions are explained in detail.

Our victim is a healthy thirty year old male with a height of 1.80m and a mass
of 80kg. Using \autoref{fig:proportions}, we estimate the distance from
respectively the angle, knee and hip to the ground to be 0.07m, 0.51m and
0.95m. The lower legs has a mass of 3.72kg and the upper legs has a mass
of 8kg\cite{Ob}. The car weighs 2400kg, the bull bar is made of stainless steel
(E=210GPa) and its most protuding part sits at 0.80m heigh.
%TODO aluminium (alloy): E=69GPa 
%TODO which of these are actually used?

Before the collision the pedestrian is located right in front of the car.
He is walking and at the moment of the crash the leg closest to the car is in
stand phase. The other leg is in swing phase. We examine the femur of the former
leg, because it is most likely to fail. The weight of both his upper and lower
leg segments are also calculated. It is assumed the weight is equally
distributed over the length of both parts, so the center of gravity is situated
in the middle of both parts.

At the time of collision the car is decelerating, but it still has a speed of 36
km/h (10 m/s). Due to the bullbar that is mounted on the bumper, the initial
contact between the body of the pedestrian and the car is limited to
the bar touching the upper leg of the pedestrian. The femur is the long
bone that provides support in the upper leg. Around the femur the hamstring
muscles, the quadriceps muscles and a layer of fat act as shock absorbers
during the impact. The literature suggests using a damping factor of roughly
15\% \cite{kannus1999comparison}. %TODO use damping factor

As only the initial phase of the impact is considered in this paper, it is
assumed that the horizontal velocity of the hip is zero at the time of impact.
% TODO WHY
The foot also remains in place, but rotates inwards at the ankle. Because of
this the bones in the lower leg do not deform. Further it is assumed that the
knee does not bend initially. So the deformation induced by the bull bar is only
reflected in the femur shaft. In reality the knee will also be affected by the
forces exerted by the bull bar. Depending on the situation and the relative strength of
both, the femur will break or the knee will be distorted. In the following
analysis however, it is assumed that the femur will absorb the initial impact.
This means we assume that the knee will not become distorted (so it will
continue to properly connect the upper and lower leg) and that the other bones
–-- from pelvis to the little bones in the foot --– are not affected initially.
Because of these (rather rough) assumptions the whole leg can be treated as one
structure which is clamped at the top (pelvis) and with a hinge at the level of
the ankle. The force exerted on this structure by the bull bar is treated as a
force concentrated in one point at a height of 85 cm. It is assumed that the
bull bar will not deform during the collision, nor that the crumple zone of the
car is activated. %TODO 85 ipv 80?

As the pedestrian is a young male it is assumed he has normal bones, not
affected by any disease. The femoral bone has an average length of 48 cm, a
shaft diameter of 2.43 cm and the femoral canal has a diameter of 13
mm.\footnote{http://www.orthopaedicsone.com}
